## Technology used in this course
### [Python](https://www.python.org/about/)
 Python is a programming language that has gained a lot of 
[popularity](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language)
in recent years.

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:

    - Beautiful is better than ugly
    - Explicit is better than implicit
    - Simple is better than complex
    - Complex is better than complicated
    - Readability counts
Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible.

### [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.

It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means 

### [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
Jupyter notebooks contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). 

Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

### [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
With Binder, one can open notebooks in an executable environment, making the code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.

### [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
Pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, 
easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

### [Keras](https://keras.io/)
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python. It lets you define layers, put them together to networks,
train networks with data and use these models for predicting on new data.

### [Rasa](https://rasa.com/docs/getting-started/overview/) 
An open source platform to build chatbots, which we will use.
 
 
### [GitHub](https://github.com)
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. 
It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality.
