    "#### What is machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a **field of artificial intelligence** that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to **learn (...) from data**, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.\n",

    "#### What is statistical learning?\n",
    "- Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science / artificial intelligence focussing on prediction accuracy and big data \n",
    "- **Statistical Learning** is a subfield of statistics focussing on model interpreatbility\n",
    "- Both Machine Learning and Statistical learning focus on supervised and unsupervised learning. They have a lot of overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is AI?\n",
    " In computer science AI research is defined as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.\n",
    "[Wikipedia AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neural Networks\n",
    "Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.\n",
    "[Wikipedia NN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) \n",
    "\n",
    "A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.\n",
